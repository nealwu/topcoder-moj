The easiest way to build moj is to import the project into Eclipse
(.classpath and .project files are provided). The script package.sh
creates:
- deploy/moj.jar (load this in the Arena)
- deploy/moj.zip (suitable for distribution)

Notes from Neal:
In Eclipse, do Project -> Clean and also build (make sure Build Automatically
is unchecked). Then run ./package.sh and then copy deploy/moj.jar over to
~/Contests/Topcoder/moj_4.18/. Finally update in the arena and restart the
arena.
